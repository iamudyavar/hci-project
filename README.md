# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

While this project uses React, Vite supports many popular JS frameworks. [See all the supported frameworks](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Vite project with Vercel.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/framework-boilerplates/vite-react&template=vite-react)

_Live Example: https://vite-react-example.vercel.app_

### Deploying From Your Terminal

You can deploy your new Vite project with a single command from your terminal using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/download):

````shell
$ vercel

## Navigation

This app uses React Router with a simple Navbar to navigate between pages:

- Home: `/`
- Upload: `/upload`
- Quiz: `/quiz`

To run locally and try navigation:

```sh
npm run dev
````

Then open the Local URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173/) and use the top navbar.

```

```
